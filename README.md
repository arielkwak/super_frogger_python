Super Frogger with Maze (please ignore my typo for this repoðŸ˜‚)!

In the beginning page, the user will enter the famous game Super Frogger. The goal is to move the frog from below to the stop by avoiding all the obstacles and not getting into the pond or out of sight. For more detail, in the bottom half, the user has to use arrow keys in order to move the frog to the middle without getting hit by an obstacle. Every time the frog is hit the frog will come back to its original spot. Once the frog has passed all the obstacles, on the upper half, the frog has to either get on turtles or logs in order to get to the other side of the river. When the frog hops on the obstacle, it will move with it. Users have to make sure to not get off the obstacle and not get out of bounds, else the frog will be set back to its original beginning spot. Once the game is done, the time it took for the user will be shown and two options will be given: to reset the game or to move to the maze game. From the maze game, the user will be able to move the frog around using arrow keys in order to solve the maze! Once the user has reached the solution, the user will have a message with how long it took.
